    <h3 class="text-center">That's great and all, but what's a maintainence calorie and why should I care?</h3>
    <p class="text-center">I'm glad you asked hypothetical naysayer! Maintainence calories are a measure of how many calories your body naturally burns over the course of a day while also maintaining the same weight, if a person wants to lose excess weight, they should aim to eat roughly 300 calories below their maintainence and if they want to gain weight, they should aim to eat 300 above.</p>
